  Today we are releasing the newest updates in our Adapters library. This post summarizes new features in the latest release as well as selected new features since our initial release in Nov 2023, including new adapter methods, new supported models and Hub updates.

Eight months ago, [we released _Adapters_](https://adapterhub.ml/blog/2023/11/introducing-adapters/), our new unified library for parameter-efficient and modular fine-tuning.
_Adapters_ stands in direct tradition to our work on `adapter-transformers` since 2020, the first open-source library for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
Since its initial release, _Adapters_ has received various updates, the newest being released today.
In this post, we'll go through some of the most exciting new features released today and in the last few months.
You can find the full list of changes in the latest release [in our release notes]().

[TOC]

You can find _Adapters_ [on GitHub](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapters) or install it via pip:

```bash
pip install -U adapters
```
